# Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) consists of many different fields and approaches, ranging from supervised learning and unsupervised learning to more specialized areas like deep learning and reinforcement learning. This diversity can make it a vast subject to explore. However, this guide provides a general introduction to the core concepts and foundational knowledge that will help you get started in ML, covering essential techniques and resources that apply across various areas of the field.


## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of linear algebra, probability theory, and statistics
- Familiarity with programming languages like Python or R, and ML libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch

## Learning Path

t.b.d.

### Fundamentals

| Title | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| [A Brief Introduction to Machine Learning by Gunnar Rätsch](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2004/fahrplan/files/105-machine-learning-paper.pdf) | Lecture Notes | This set of lecture notes provides a high-level overview of machine learning concepts, covering both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. A great starting point for newcomers. |
| [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/) | Book | A foundational book that is freely available online. It covers a wide range of topics in statistical learning, from linear models to neural networks. A bit more theoretical, but very comprehensive. |
| [Model Evaluation, Model Selection, and Algorithm Selection in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12808.pdf) | Paper | This paper provides an overview of best practices for evaluating machine learning models, including different strategies for model selection and algorithm comparison. It’s a must-read for understanding how to assess model performance. |
