# Transformers

In recent years, Transformers have emerged as one of the most groundbreaking developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Their ability to process complex sequences of data has revolutionized how we model natural language, images, and other data structures. This learning path presents various resources, including lectures, research articles, and tutorials, to help you gain a deep understanding of these powerful models.

## Prerequisites

- **Basic knowledge of Machine Learning and Deep Learning**: Understanding the basics of neural networks, how they work, and how they are trained is essential. Concepts such as backpropagation, gradient descent, and overfitting should be familiar.
- **Knowledge of Linear Algebra and Statistics**: Mathematical foundations, particularly linear algebra (matrices, vectors) and statistics, are crucial, as many of the concepts in Transformers are mathematically demanding.
- **Familiarity with Python and libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch**: Practical experience with Python and popular deep learning frameworks is helpful for understanding the implementations and conducting experiments with Transformers.
- **Basic understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Since Transformers were originally developed for NLP, a basic knowledge of this field, such as tokenization and embeddings, is beneficial.
