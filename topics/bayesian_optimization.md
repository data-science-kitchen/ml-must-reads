# Bayesian Optimization

Bayesian optimization is a method for global optimization of black-box functions. It is often used in the context of sequential experimental design, where each experiment is expensive (i.e., in terms of time or cost).

| 1    | [Bayesian Optimization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZODGJzKmD0) | Video | This is a talk by [Roman Garnett](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~garnett/) at the Probabilistic Numerics Spring School 2023 in TÃ¼bingen. It provides a general introduction into the topics of Bayesian optimization, Active Learning and Bayesian experimental design. The slides shown in this talk are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/probabilistic-numerics/probnum-spring-school/blob/main/2023_slides/school/garnett.pdf). |
| 2    | [Exploring Bayesian Optimization](https://distill.pub/2020/bayesian-optimization/) | Paper/Tutorial | An interactive tutorial that illustrates the fundamental aspects of Bayesian optimization with a tangible example. It introduces the most common *acquisition functions* and provides a list of libraries and toolkits with capabilities to perform Bayesian optimization. |
